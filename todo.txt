# Medium prio
input should be split across lines
subtask scores are reasonable (finite, add up etc.)
(hard) are there undefined variables? basically, some variable got renamed but we forgot to change all occurences.
exclude dir cmd line option
warn if testdata size is HUGE

# Low prio
only check subtask box if the problem has more than one subtask
anti chatgpt sample case
no EOF in input validators
check that no input validator uses bits/stdc++.h
